I am a fourth-year PhD student in the <a href='https://www.uu.nl/en/research/interaction/visualization-and-graphics'>Visualization and Graphics group</a> at <a href='https://www.uu.nl/en'>Utrecht University</a> under supervision of Dr. Evanthia Dimara and Prof. Alexandru Telea. 

I am Ba≈üak and prefer to be addressed with she and her pronouns.

My primary research focus is on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) with interactive data visualizations.
